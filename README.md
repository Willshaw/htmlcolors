# HMTL Colors
Tool to show HTML colours with their text names and hex values

I  made this tool so I can quickly grab some colors when prototyping.
	
Also I'm English, it's very hard to write color and not colour, but I wanted to be consistent - so color it is.

The names and hex values are in seperate `<span>` tags so double click, ctrl+c (or whatever that is on mac) soemthing for quick access.

Some ideas to improve (if anyone fancies helping):

* single click to copy to clip board
* filters
* more logical order by (currently alphabetical)
